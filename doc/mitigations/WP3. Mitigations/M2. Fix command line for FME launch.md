## Context

This code addresses a potential vulnerability in the construction of commands to be executed using concatenated strings without properly sanitised input. Attackers can exploit this weakness by injecting malicious commands into the input parameters, resulting in the unauthorised execution of arbitrary code on the system.

## Implementation

### Obtaining the tasklist executable

The code below returns the absolute path of the tasklist executable:

```java
private String getValidatedTaskListPath() {  
    String windowsDir = System.getenv("windir");  
  
    if (windowsDir == null) {  
        logger.warn("The 'windir' environment variable is not set. Falling back to C:\\Windows.");  
        windowsDir = "C:\\Windows"; // Fallback par défaut si la variable n'est pas définie  
    }  
  
    File taskListFile = new File(windowsDir + "\\System32\\tasklist.exe");  
  
    if (!taskListFile.exists() || !taskListFile.canExecute()) {  
        logger.error("The tasklist.exe file does not exist or is not executable.");  
        throw new SecurityException("Tasklist file does not exist or is not executable.");  
    }  
	if (shouldVerifyAuthenticity() && !verifyDigitalSignatureWithPowerShell(taskListFile)) {  
	    logger.error("The tasklist.exe file has an invalid or missing digital signature.");  
	    throw new SecurityException("The tasklist.exe file has been tampered with.");  
	}
    return taskListFile.getAbsolutePath();  
}
```

It is possible the check (in windows) that the `tasklist.exe` file was not tampered with. This behaviour can be configured with the configuration flag `check.authenticity`:
```java
private boolean shouldVerifyAuthenticity() {  
    try {  
        return SystemUtils.IS_OS_WINDOWS && Boolean.parseBoolean(config.getProperty("check.authenticity"));  
    } catch (Exception e) {  
        return false;  
    }  
}
```

The method `verifyDigitalSignatureWithPowerShell` uses Powershell to check that the authenticode signature of the `tasklist.exe` executable is correct. In other terms, it tests that the application is a genuine Windows executable and has not been tampered with:
```java
private boolean verifyDigitalSignatureWithPowerShell(File file) {  
    try {  
        Process process = new ProcessBuilder("powershell.exe",  
                "Get-AuthenticodeSignature", file.getAbsolutePath())  
                .redirectErrorStream(true)  
                .start();  
  
        int exitCode = process.waitFor();  
  
        // In PowerShell, an exit code of 0 typically means success  
        return exitCode == 0;  
    } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {  
        logger.error("Error while verifying digital signature with PowerShell.", e);  
        return false;  
    }  
}
```

The following modifications were made in method `getCurrentFmeInstances` of class `extract-task-fmedesktop/src/main/java/ch/asit_asso/extract/plugins/fmedesktop/FmeDesktopPlugin.java`:

1. **Using`ProcessBuilder`** :
    
    - **Why**: `ProcessBuilder` is used instead of `Runtime.exec()` for more control over the process, such as specifying the working directory or configuring the environment if necessary. No specific working directory is used here, but this would allow the process to be run with limited permissions.
    
2. **Runtime limitation** :
    
    - Why**: To prevent abuse via a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, the process execution time is limited to 10 seconds. If the process exceeds this limit, it is stopped, and an error is logged and raised.
    
3. **Closing streams** :
    
    - **Why**: As in the previous version, open streams are closed in the `finally` block, ensuring that resources are always released, even in the event of an error.
    
4. **Operating system validation** :
    
    - **Why**: An exception is raised with a clear error message if the operating system is neither Windows nor Linux, as this code does not support other systems.
    
5. **Enhanced exception handling** :
    
    - **Why**: Exceptions are handled more finely, with specific messages for cases of interruption (`InterruptedException`) or execution delay (`TimeoutException`). This helps to diagnose the cause of the error more precisely.
    
6. **Limited permissions** :
    
    - **Why**: The use of `processBuilder.directory(null)` shows that the process runs with default permissions. If necessary, a working directory with stricter permissions could be defined here.
    
7. **Secure execution** :
    
    - **Why**: Commands do not depend on user input, which minimizes the risk of command injection. However, the use of `ProcessBuilder` offers additional protection by avoiding risky dynamic command constructs.

### Threat modelling :

1. **Command injection**: Mitigation with `ProcessBuilder` allows better control of system commands, reducing the risk of injection.
    
2. **Use of non-validated system paths** : System paths are extracted from environment variables or secure hardcoded commands. If necessary, additional validations can be added to ensure that paths are safe.

3. **Malware-injected executable**: On windows we can use the `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` cmdlet to verify whether the application is genuine or not
    
4. **Leakage of sensitive information** : Log information is limited. However, in a production environment, it would be wise to hide or reduce the amount of sensitive information logged.
    
5. **Denial of service (DoS)** attack: Process execution time limited to 10 seconds, preventing a long or blocked process from consuming too many resources.
    
6. **Insufficient error handling**: More refined exception handling with specific messages for different error types, facilitating debugging and error handling.
    
7. **Use of insecure processes** : The process is executed with the permissions of the current directory. If execution with minimal permissions is required, this can be configured via `ProcessBuilder`.
