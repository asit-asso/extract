## Context
In its current implementation, the method `getXMLNodeListFromXPath` returns a list of nodes given any XPath expression. The vulnerability lies in tha fact that the XPath expression can be manipulated to return any arbitrary content and leak information to the attacker or even result in a denial of service.

## Implementation
The potential vulnerability exists in multiple modules:
- `EasySdiv4`
- `QGISPrint`
- `SampleConnector`

### `EasySdiv4`
The method `getXMLNodeListFromXPath` is called from two places in the module `EasySdiv4:1168` and `EasySdiv4:1178`:

```java
final NodeList orderList = getXMLNodeListFromXPath(document, config.getProperty("getOrders.xpath.orderlist"));
```

and 
```java
final NodeList productList = this.getXMLNodeListFromXPath(document,  
        config.getProperty("getOrders.xpath.productlist").replace("<guid>", guid));
```
### `QGISPrint`
The method `getXMLNodeListFromXPath` is called from a single place in the module `QGISPrintPlugin:650`:

```java
final NodeList idsList = this.getXMLNodeListFromXPath(document,  
        String.format(this.config.getProperty("getFeature.xpath.gmlId"), coverageLayer));
```

The input of the method is controlled by the application, so there is no injection, unless the attacker also controls the properties files. But, in this case, the security of this snippet won't matter as much.
### `SampleConnector`

The code is almost the same as for `EasySdiv4`.
### Best practices
The input of the method in each case is controlled by the application (properties files), so there is no injection, unless the attacker also controls the properties files. But, in this case, the security of this snippet won't matter as much.

In any case, the use of variables instead of relying on `String.format` is strongly advised as it escapes all unwanted content.
