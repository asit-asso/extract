## Context
The extraction of information to a secure vault or external configuration involves securely transferring sensitive data from an application or system to a dedicated storage solution or configuration management system. This is critical for maintaining data confidentiality, ensuring compliance, and enabling centralised management of sensitive information. By utilising a secure vault, organisations can mitigate the risks of data breaches, streamline access control, and facilitate the deployment of applications in varied environments, ensuring that critical information is both accessible and protected.

## Implementation

All users in the initializer class were removed except for the `system` user. Furthermore, passwords are not exposed in the code anymore, but generated at runtime.

Please refer to [T1. Remove user operator.md](..%2FWP5.%20Implementing%20the%20todos%2FT1.%20Remove%20user%20operator.md) for an explanation on how this point was mitigated.
