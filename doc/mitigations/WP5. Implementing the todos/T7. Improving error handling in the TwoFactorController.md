## Context
Method `TwoFactorController::requestTwoFactorAuthentication` has lots of todos `//TODO : Better error management`. The error management cannot be further improved without heavily changing the structure of the method. Furthermore, the method has been security audited and carefully examined. The most important checks are made and corresponding errors are thrown.

> It should be noted that todos in those locations show potential attackers that the code may have potential holes that could be exploited.

## Improvements
One way to improve the code is to throw specific TwoFactor exceptions that can be handled separately in the `ExceptionHandler`, either for audit purposed or for displaying errors differently. Currently, there's little difference between different error conditions.
