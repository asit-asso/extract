## Context
The management of the task history is managed in the `RequestsController` class in the`createSkippedTakHistoryRecord`. This is not a security issue in itself, but makes the controller bear multiple responsibilities, which is not optimal.

## Suggestion
The decision was taken to leave the situation as it is, because it would take much more time to apply a mitigation to it, because it has multiple dependencies. The problem can be tackled in multiple ways though:
- **Handler**: In order to decouple the presentation layer from the business layer, we could extract the logic from the controller and put in on the handler class `RequestHandler`.  This would reduce the number of dependencies on the controller and delegate the business logic to another class.
- **Events**: In order to handle the creation of historical events, one great way to do it is to publish specific events, such as `task.skipped`and delegate the saving of records to an appropriate listener.
