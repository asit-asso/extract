## Context

With the implementation of **WP6**, the `UsersInitializer` class is now largely redundant. All pre-initialized users and any clear-text passwords must be removed from the system.
## System user
The system user remains essential for certain platform functionalities and cannot be removed. However, the password is no longer hardcoded. Instead, it is dynamically generated at runtime as a GUID v4. You can find the system password in the logs during the first run:

```log
tomcat                | 14:48:27.323 [main] WARN  c.a.e.initializers.UsersInitializer - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tomcat                | 14:48:27.323 [main] WARN  c.a.e.initializers.UsersInitializer -    SYSTEM USER PASSWORD: f083ece3-ef5e-4f11-9427-24ed36ef9a0c
tomcat                | 14:48:27.323 [main] WARN  c.a.e.initializers.UsersInitializer - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

Note however that the user must be activated before logging in.

### Controls
It is possible to define both the default email address for the `system` user and if the password should be logged during the initialisation phase. The constants `UserInitializer.SYSTEM_USER_EMAIL` and `UserInitializer.SYSTEM_USER_SHOW_PASSWORD` control this behaviour.
## Security Considerations

To mitigate risks, the system user should remain inactive, if the password is exposed in the logs. However, the risk of exposure is limited. Indeed, if the attacker was able to see the email in the logs, it would likely indicate broader security issues within the system.
