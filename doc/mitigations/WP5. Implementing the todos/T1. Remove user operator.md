## Context

With the implementation of **WP6**, the `UsersInitializer` class is now largely redundant. All pre-initialized users and any clear-text passwords must be removed from the system.
## System user
The system user remains essential for certain platform functionalities and cannot be removed. However, the password is no longer hardcoded. Instead, it is dynamically generated at runtime as a GUID v4. You can find the system password in the logs during the first run:

```log
tomcat                | 14:48:27.323 [main] WARN  c.a.e.initializers.UsersInitializer - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tomcat                | 14:48:27.323 [main] WARN  c.a.e.initializers.UsersInitializer -    SYSTEM USER PASSWORD: f083ece3-ef5e-4f11-9427-24ed36ef9a0c
tomcat                | 14:48:27.323 [main] WARN  c.a.e.initializers.UsersInitializer - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

Note however that the user must be activated before logging in.

## Security Considerations

To mitigate risks, the system user should remain inactive, given that the password is exposed in the logs. However, the exposure is limited, as it only appears in the logs, and if an attacker has access to the logs, it would likely indicate broader security issues within the system.
