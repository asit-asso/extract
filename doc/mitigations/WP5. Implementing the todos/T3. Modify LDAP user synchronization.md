## Context

The `LDAPUtils` class contains the method `updateFromLdap` that is reused in several places. A todo suggests that is should be put elsewhere. As it stands, however, it's too complicated to modify this part of the system without completely overhauling the synchronization system.
## Suggestion

The `LDAPUtils` class is not the best place to put the `updateFromLdap` method. We suggest the creation of a `LdapSyncService`, accessible to the entire application and which fully manages the mapping of an LDAP user to the database.
