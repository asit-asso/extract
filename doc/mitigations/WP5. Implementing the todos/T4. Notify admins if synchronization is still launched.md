## Context
There is a condition in the `LdapSynchronizationJobRunner::run` method that should normally never be triggered. If the synchronisation is disabled and LDAP is also disabled, this condition should never be true:

```java
if (!this.ldapSettings.isEnabled() || !this.ldapSettings.isSynchronizationEnabled()) {
// TODO warn admins ?
throw new IllegalStateException(  
        "The LDAP synchronization was started, but it is turned off in the settings.");
```

> [!info]
> After discussion it was agreed that this feature is not necessary.

## Implementation
The todo was removed and replaced by the following log:
```java
this.logger.error("LDAP synchronization should not be running, since it is disabled.");
```
