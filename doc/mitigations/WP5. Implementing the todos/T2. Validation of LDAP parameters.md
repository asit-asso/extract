## Context

The `LDAPSettings` class contains an `isValid` method which is supposed to test whether the current LDAP configuration is valid. However, the original method was empty.
## Implementation

We've implemented the method by checking all the important parameters.

The following checks have been made:

1. **LDAP enabled**: If LDAP is not enabled, no further checks are required.
2. **LDAP servers**: Check that the list of LDAP servers is not empty.
3. **Base DN** : Base DN must be set for LDAP to work.
4. **User classes and attributes** : Attributes such as `userObjectClass`, `userNameAttribute`, `loginAttribute` and `mailAttribute` are essential for LDAP to function properly.
5. **Administrator and operator groups**: These groups must be defined for role management.
6. **LDAP synchronization**: If synchronization is enabled, synchronization parameters such as username and password must be defined and valid.
7. **Encryption type**: It is important to define whether LDAP uses STARTTLS or LDAPS.

For each failed check, an error line is written in the log file and the method returns `false`. 

## Tests

The method's unit tests are on `LDAPSettingsTest`:
- Each test tests a specific condition of the `isValid` method by defining the necessary values, then calling `isValid()`.
