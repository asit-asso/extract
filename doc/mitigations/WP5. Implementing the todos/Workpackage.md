The goal of this workpackage is to see whether some todos are still relevant.

> [!note]
> Leaving todos in the code suggest incomplete code or tests. This information can be used to attackers to find potential vulnerabilities.
> 
> **All todos** should be replaced by tickets, that do a way better job at capturing requirements.
